  <p> A <b>darkness</b>, more absolute than has ever before been conceived by man or beast covered the earth. The animals lowed, the people cowered under rocks and trees. Slowly our plucky upstart made her way through the tricks, trials and tribulations of life.</p>

          <div class="worked">
          <p>She worked.</p>
          <p>She worked. </p>

          <p>She worked. </p>

          </div>

   <p>The pay was lowly and the indignities manifold. Objects were thrown, tempers were lost, sometimes forever, and feet were stamped. </p> 
  <p>Our erstwhile anti-heroine wafted like flotsam and jetsam, through the dark, scorched world of work, always hoping, always searching, always believing that next job would be the leap home... </p>

  <p> You are in luck: our heroine is endlessly fascinating and only know how to present information to the delight and delectation of my fellow man. </p>
  <p> Walk with us... for the greatest story <span>never </span> told.</p>

<p>
  As a plucky youth, she attended school, obtaining a degree from <a href="wwww2.warwick.ac.uk">The University of Warwick</a> where in she met many people and learnt so, so much about herself and indeed others. After a year of living decadently in Bordeaux, it was off to London, to toil as the moon was high in an <a href="http://wwww.bonhams.co.uk">auction house</a>. Proving basically compotent she worked for an art dealer. Meh. Then, in 2007, our main character moved to America, land of hope 'n' freedom, to continue in life and doeth good. The culmination of this ambition is her unerring commitment to front-end web development.
